# CS-255
The client for this project is called DriverPass. They wanted me to design a 
system in which they provide students with the ability to purchase packages
that contain lesson, practice tests, and driving lessons. They wanted a web
based interface that allows users to register and log in. They wanted users
to choose between three packages that provide them with support for their 
driving test. They can make appointments for the driving portion of the course
by contacting DriverPass. I think I did especially well on capturing the client's
requirements. I read over the conversation between the client and created user
cases that captured the user requirments. If I could revise one part of the document
I would revise the overall detail of the buissness requirement document. To improve
it I would add in more detail such as instead of the performance of the system should
be fairly fast I should say a low powered device should be able to run the system without
any stuttering or loading issues. I interpreted the user's needs into the system design
by reading the conversation line by line and noting any requirement stated by DriverPass.
It is important to consider the user's needs because these features they requested are
needed for the system to work. Some techniques I would use in the future to analyze
and design a system are to make sure to read over the provided documents and 
include as much detail as possible.
